In March 2023, Google transitioned to Material Design v3 for Google Docs, Slides, and Sheets.

Amongst many things, this change also removed the "Last edit was ______ ago" text in the menubar.

This userscript is an improved version of this [one](https://gist.github.com/ZachTheDev/0df884f490ec4a171ff0a8f8403a7926) (from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/googledocs/comments/11miktw/want_back_the_last_edit_was_text_install_this/)) that works in Firefox.

Not tested on Chrome.
