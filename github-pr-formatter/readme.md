This is a userscript I wanted to use typescript for.

I found this nice webpack template from [this repo](https://github.com/Trim21/webpack-userscript-template?tab=WTFPL-1-ov-file), and decided to clean it up for my purposes.

Its original README file is in the /docs directory.

If you look into the git history, you should find when I *just* cleaned this template up before I used it for this current userscript; I think it's a good starting point for my more complex userscripts moving forward.

To build you own dist js file (bundled userscript js):
npm install
npm run buildProd

Made this for my work workflow to make it easier to focus on PRs that actually need my attention.
