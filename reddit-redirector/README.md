# Reddit Redirector

Mobile reddit website sucks, made this because the existing userscripts I found either didn't work on Firefox Android, or didn't *replace* the original reddit.com url with the libreddit url in browser history.

Not synched up to Greasyforks via web sockets like my other userscripts because I'm lazy tonight.
