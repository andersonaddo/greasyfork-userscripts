# New Instance Button for Libreddit 

Libreddit instances are struggling under the new Reddit API limits. Use this userscript to automatically get redirected to another Libreddit instance if the one you're at is giving you the "Too Many Requests" error.

https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/470863-automatic-libreddit-quota-redirector is set up to automatically pull from this repo (using webhooks) to update.
