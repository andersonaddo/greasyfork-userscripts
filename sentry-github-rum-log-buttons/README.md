(June 2024 update): They've updated the pages for Sentry, so this userscript is a little broken.

Adds 3 buttons to Sentry issue pages:
- A button to go to the RUM link provided by sentry (if exists)
- A button to to go a query of relevant session recordings for the issue
- A button to go to a query of relevant logs for the issue.

It also shows the seconds in the timestamp for sentry issues.
